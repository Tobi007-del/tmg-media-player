# TVP CHRONICLES: State & Intent Architecture (S.I.A.)

### *The Basis of the New TVP Architecture*

I’ve managed to build a low-level, path-addressable state kernel with synchronous mediation and batched observation that mirrors the JS Event Loop. Now, it is a well-known fact that with great power comes great responsibility. And this class or as I like to call it, **The Reactor** is quite powerful; so much so that I’m actually sitting down to write this.

It’s all possible with Proxies, but let me leave the technical details for a moment and explain the concept of *why* before we go into what I have cognitively decided to shape as the *how*.
---

### The Philosophy: Collecting Like Terms

One thing a lot of web video players have in common is firing events that didn’t happen just to make a media technology (and all parties involved) believe it’s the native platform video element by all means necessary. A media technology is the video itself or whatever API playing the video so it may be referred to as a "tech" from now on.

Now, I’ve decided to fall back to a rather raw, commonly known principle in basic algebra: **the art of collecting like terms.**

If you want two different devices to fit into the same slot, oh! software engineers that like to call themselves "System Architects" quickly build an Adapter, a State Manager, a Context, and a Request Manager. That’s way too much. The issue is not the complexity, but the fact that no one is _thinking_. Everyone is just making software that follows the standard, but standard is not a constant; it's just what’s comfortable and predictable at that current time.

A rather simpler road to follow will still include the adapter, but let me give you an analogy, I love those.

> Picture a room with air conditioners that are turned off. They only turn back on when the entity inside is hot. You’re an engineer, and you are told to build the terms to make that happen.
> A classic regular Web Dev, I’d call him **Bob** would sit and see: _"Okay, a human is in the room. So, when human sweats, AC on. Problem solved for all humans. Case closed."_
> Then, the human is replaced with a **Pig**. Take note: pigs don’t sweat.
> Bob will go back to building and say, _"Hmm, one solution to serve two entities... I need an adapter and all those layers I mentioned earlier."_ These layers, mind you, have to learn how that creature works to handle changes. Because of how web devs are trained on event systems, Bob is going to make that pig sweat. Yeah, release fake sweat if he has to, just so his system can detect sweat and turn the AC on.

With that rigidity, the whole system needs reconfiguration to be able to see to it that the pig sweats because you might need changes everywhere. There is no stable core.

---

### The Proposal: A Declarative Core

Now, I who happens to be not your regular dev have a proposal. It’s not something too new, but for libraries, it’s a concept that will be considered experimental (though it’s already quite comfortable for apps and websites). Simply put, it's state pluralism.

I’m going to build a system that says: **"If entity is hot, turn AC on."** Just as requested, declaratively.

I’m not listening to sweat, no. My adapter layer is one that says: _"Hey entity, I give you a state: `hot = false`. When you turn hot, change it to `true`."_

I’ll be listening. Mind you, I do not care _what_ changes you, neither do I need to know the intricacies of that change. So if you sweat when you're hot, or you’re hot when you’re nervous but don’t sweat, it’s not my business. Just switch the state.

This way, my core is stable; it never changes. The "like terms" were collected, which is the fact that they can all be _hot_. I’m not gonna force any pig to sweat, or pour water on the pig when I see it’s nervous and then tell everyone it’s sweating (including myself, apparently).

---

### The Mechanics: Mediators and Listeners

Now, that was the easy part as everyone knows we can just change object properties like `entity.hot = false` but it would have been the hard part because before 2015, it wasn’t possible in JavaScript to intercept those changes and build that complex description I mentioned at the start. It’s probably similar to what powers many reactive frameworks out there. I’ll be bold enough to mention Vue 3, though it’s probably not as performant (giving myself an obvious downplay).

Anyways, let’s continue. You’re here to see the rules of my new architecture because, with the power of Proxies, I have implemented **State Mediators** and **State Listeners**.

Let me explain what all that entails. Drop all your English constraints and just listen to what I translated mine to:

1. **State Mediator:** Must involve you _before_ or _exactly when_ something happens to state. It’s synchronous. It tells you when something is about to be Set, Gotten, or Deleted even. You can terminate them by returning a `TERMINATOR` (I don't wanna release technical details, just pretend to understand that).
2. **State Listener:** This is called _after_ something happened to state.

Now mind you, only 3 things can happen to state: a **Get**, **Set**, or **Delete**.

- **Gets** can be mediated during the get to control what is returned.
- **Sets** can be mediated _before_ the set and then listened to _after_ the set.
- **Deletes** function exactly the same as Sets.

So, you can’t do both (mediate and listen) with gets, but you can do both with sets.
I'll suggest, use `.set()` for input integrity; sanitization like some bouncer while `.get()` for simple formatting or output derivation like a value of 20% to be derived based on whatever video duration is later.

### Surgical Precision: Deep Reactivity

When you build something as powerful as that, it means you can solve problems at the root; if you’re fast, sharp, and surgical. Not everyone can handle it, but I know you’re smart if you’re still reading (either that or you’re AI).

Since it’s too hard to make sense of the "before" and the "after" and when to use them, I have defined two bright new concepts to join the party. That brings me to the title: **State and Intent**.

**State** is fact. It can only be determined _after_ something happens (like humans being hot after sweating, or pigs being hot after being nervous which is an assumption btw, I just have to stick with them for now). State is rather generic now.

**Intent** is my new inclusion. An Intent is a wish, or rather a request. Something you _want_, no matter how dreamy you are. But like everything in life, there are limits.

Another analogy for a minute (forget about Bob though, he was probably sacked and replaced with me before he'll start making other things sweat).

> The **User Interface (UI)** is a side effect of State, right? Now stay with me. But it’s not just some state mirror; it’s also a medium for users to communicate with the system like a mirror where you could adjust your looks, I wish I had that :(.

Now things get really surgical here. React.js is a popular JS framework that brought state to the limelight, and they are slaves to it. They even do this thing where if state changes, they build the whole system again "virtually" and then compare that to the real thing just to then change what actually did. Like, bro, chill all that CPU so I can be dumb. (I do love it though, it’s easy on the brain).

My approach is not for the weak, mind you. Everyone is experimenting with state on the web now. There’s even this thing called **Signals** that react to changes on an object like `entity.hot = true`, but it cannot handle nested properties though, so it’s not surgical enough. It’s like surgery, but you can’t cut anything that doesn’t have just skin so always one layer deep, leading people to do scary things just to pretend to be reactive. I saw it and I ran immediately. I mean, the idea of removing complexity is to make users as dumb as can be. We are not on this earth to code, so why would someone remove complexity only to add more?

Anyways, let me not talk as if I’m not kind of a culprit, though I’m trying to make a stable surface for that core so everything will be magical.

I got lost a little there. Back to my **Intent** proposal. I’m taking them as wishes like you telling the mirror that "I want a pointed nose." That’s nothing new, as websites do have buttons, but what I’m implementing is how to do it by **collecting like terms** which is **building a contract**. I don’t want the Air Conditioner to know the terms of a pig being hot so that it can work for any animal. That event behavior locks things to the web and makes things that cannot be easily extended. My new take on things will probably allow me to make an array of players for all platforms.

As I mentioned earlier, State is a declaration of _what is_ after what may have happened. Now, that’s easy; a mirror just shows what it sees. When you want to change what is shown to also change _what is_, people tend to leave state and start calling what is often called **Methods** or **Functions**. Mind you, you have to know them to call them. Like now, with my pointed nose comment, I have to say `human.straightenNose()` and then it will do it since it implements it and allows it. That, to me, is already a learning curve; it means learning the API for the properties _and_ methods.

Now I bring to you something else:
A human should have a `human.state.nose` and a `human.intent.nose`. So, hey, all you need to know is a human’s got a nose, and everyone knows that.

Basically put, I’m saying we shouldn’t use methods or call functions to change state. That entails knowing that `pig.makeNervous()` changes `pig.hot` to true. With mine, I’m insinuating:
`pig.intent.hot = true` (Request) -> when needed to change -> `pig.state.hot = true` (Fact).

The system can call `man.straightenNose()` or `woman.tiltNose()` internally. Either way, I don’t want to have to check: _if man, straighten; if woman, tilt._ I’m just saying bring state to **appeals** too, not just declaration. Like how JS was taken server-side, I’ve taken the mantle upon myself and have thought of a way everyone can do this without going crazy. So I went crazy so you all don’t have to.

---

### The Rules of the Reactor

After vigorous thinking (this is a long document btw), back to the rules.

I want to point out a fact before anyone says I said you can wish for anything. Remember that even in life, it’s not just our situation that’s locked to the environ we find ourselves in. We don’t go wishing for what we can’t have or at least, we learnt that the hard way. So we never stopped wishing, but we always knew they were to no avail when it was bigger than what was permitted by whatever situation you are in.

Now, one big bold statement: **You should not mediate Intents unless necessary.**

A wish must happen when initiated. The puppet doesn’t hold the string when the puppeteer pulls. He can only maybe _not_ do what was intended if it’s broken, or it’s not supposed to, or just can’t. So it’s like you can dream, but **State** (which is your situation) will not stop you, but will remind you when you look around. _"No more way for poor people,"_ once said by The Great Mavo, after all.

But your situation, let’s say your parents can listen to your wishes to change your state. That line says it all. **State can be mediated and listened to**, as it’s what the UI (or mirror) will be listening to so it can reflect your new state or situation. It’s truly just a side effect. Your clothes don’t change your financial status; they reflect it, _after_ the fact that you are rich. Except it’s fake life you’re living, don’t let me quote Mavo again abeg, Nigeria to the world.

Now let me clog some holes. Intent doesn’t need clamping if the UI that allows one to request intent is already clamped by state (since it’s a reflection of what you can handle) but you can mediate it to clamp for safety which is "necessary", your choice; some parents stop their kids from wishing after all. Your brain cannot allow you to dream too far when it has seen your account, otherwise you might run mad.

But this is where things get fun. The UI could reflect both your **‘Want’** and your **‘Has’**. It’s a whole new twist to what can be reflected. It’s like seeing your dream self _and_ your actual self in a mirror if someone wanted to push the reactor to its limits.

---

### The Compromise: Rejection and the Event Loop

I don’t think I’ve drawn enough lines though. One more thing: a new concept was added to the flow `reject()`, borrowed from web event listeners `preventDefault()` concept.

Since intents are not often mediated, anyone who was reflecting that optimistic wish (let’s say a range slider that wants to move faster than "time"; if you get my drift, I mean video current time btw) should at least check for "if rejected", that way it doesn't have to snap back if it hits a wrong value while being optimistic cuz it never snapped, it's logical resistance made possible with the event loop; consulting the future in the past. Because, like I said, the internals of magic is surgery.

It’s like the mirror will allow your dream self to reflect, but when it’s maybe too sunny, it will not. The reflector that wants to be optimistic for good user experience must take the responsibility of being **smart** to know: _"When should I just not reflect what is not, even when I am commanded to?"_

It’s not always that we should be allowed to deceive ourselves, after all. Everything should have limits. Great responsibility for such power. Even analytics could log that. But there is one drawback: the developer is not controlled by state-locked UI, so he can push intents to its bounds, and we don’t want to lose our right of being so watchful that we can know what someone is _and_ what they dream to be.

That brings me to an edge case which we can only solve with what I call a "compromise," in order not to overcomplicate the existing architecture that mirrors what people are already used to (so they won’t call me some mad man who found code so menial that he’s just painting his mind with it now).

---

#### The Parable of the King

The compromise entails this: twisting the mental model a little. **Resolving of an intent is stamped by the media tech or higher powers but it’s handled by optimistic listeners or maybe even the tech itself in the case of a higher power.** Though they could be smart or not. Take note though, higher power is just anyone who managed to be registered as a listener before the tech itself.

Let me give you an instance of a **King**.
He can wish for anything. Say: `man.intent.flying = true`.
You can’t change his wish; it’s history. But you can try to grant it.

So, let’s say the **Media Technology** (Adviser) decides if this is physically or rather technically possible. If it is not, he calls **Reject**, saying: _"Hey, optimistic listeners or rather, slaves to the king’s word, don’t suddenly start tryna reflect his dream."_

Now, I would do the portrayal of two slave types: an **Artist** and a **Court Man**.

1. **The Court Man (Smart Optimist):** Checks if intent was rejected. If rejected, he does nothing.
2. **The Artist (Reckless Optimist):** Doesn't even check and just goes, _"I’m painting no matter what, just wish away."_ True or not, you will see it.

It opens the mind to real amazing possibilities with what should just be code. It makes things a bit more interesting. Playing at a root level so low as object set interceptions, too many high-level operations or principles are possible. I mean, the analogy of a kingdom sounds like smart code, like you could do a whole village of stubborn and sensible people. Two things created with the same core could behave so differently.

---

### Implementation: Capture and Bubble

Now, that’s it without code. But since I introduced the **Event Wave**, I’d say `reject()` is _only_ for Intents. They’re like state.

- **The Tech (Owner) / Higher Power:** Should only call it in the **Capture Phase** so it runs first.
- **The Smart Optimist:** Should always listen on the **Bubble Phase** so they can check if it was rejected.
- **The Crazy Renderer:** Could listen anywhere and just paint wishes.

You can tell it’s something different. I mean damn, it feels like telling a story. I’m just sad a little complexity was introduced, but what we are taking as the edge case is **Rejecting** (prevent default) - a progressive intent enhancement only to be called on the capture listener. Other than that, that’s all.

We already declared it was for only intents, but if I made them cancel tech behavior, that will be stupid because you could just not have intended it. So it’s a turn on the system. Since I said the tech may not mediate and block nor clamp or revert, it is its way of fighting back to anyone who’s listening that’s not the stamper.

It’s like I’m a wizard, a wish granter. And then you, mere human, are trying to listen to wishes too. You’re not even gonna know the terms of granting and then start trying something crazy. So to help you progressively, I’ll tell you when you’re doing more harm than good. This means techs have to listen on the capture phase. Intent owners have to use capture so they could warn to prevent outright ignorance for those who would listen.

It’s like how you have to make sure you go to the front of a crowd or line and stand so everyone can hear you, especially when everyone is the same height. It’s also why only people that are sitting should be optimistic; they should always bubble if they’re gonna work on intent. Except from the owner of the intent state, he should capture to act and declare all others can _if_ they happen to be listening, meaning all optimists and general listeners should be waiting at the end of the line or sitting down.

**Remember this**: Rejection is not a rollback mechanism.
It is a signal of disapproval, not enforcement.

If anything, it should be called `warnStupidPeople` since I had to go out of my way for work that nobody sent you in the first place. I’m talking as the Media Tech, not to you; Dear Reader.

I also added propagation, but I’m taking it as it’s for those that are doing some state changes that should be kept secret and want to just quiet everyone for a moment. Because unlike the browser, this API is open and everyone is a first-class citizen. There are no listeners running outside the event wave on its own phase. It gives more freedom after all. True surgery. Because the truth is in a library that’s ready for extensibility and that open source contribution. You can’t treat other devs like slaves. It’s like a lib builder, something low-level and all-powerful so you can define the rules all over again. The code would be used by devs anyway, so there’s no actual prevent default when I’m not selling them a product but an extensible core. So I’m part of the event loop sadly; any smart ass can break everything in one line. That’s my sacrifice.

### Semantic Structuring: Plain State vs. Intentful State

You are not forced to use Intents. If you are building a simple application where data updates are immediate and undisputed, the S.I.A. engine functions perfectly as a hyper-fast, standard state manager. You can strictly use plain state and ignore the complexities of the rejection event loop.

However, the moment you introduce Intents into your architecture, **semantics matter**. 

If you use an `intent` object to capture user requests, your `state` object must act strictly as the factual mirror to that `intent`. Because `state` is now semantically locked to your intents, you must separate your other data. 

Do not pollute your `state` object with data that doesn't require an intent. Instead, categorize them semantically:
- **`intent`**: For asynchronous requests or delayed validations (e.g., `intent.playing = true`).
- **`state`**: The factual mirror of granted intents (e.g., `state.playing = true`).
- **`settings` / `config`**: For immediate, undisputed user preferences (e.g., `settings.playbackRate = 2`).
- **`status`**: For read-only system facts (e.g., `status.network = "offline"`).

```javascript
import { reactive, intent } from 'sia-reactor';

// A perfectly structured S.I.A. Data DOM
const player = reactive({
  intent: intent({ playing: false, fullscreen: false }), // Can be rejected
  state: { playing: false, fullscreen: false },          // The factual mirror
  settings: { volume: 50, theme: "dark" },               // Immediate, plain state
  status: { buffering: false, duration: 120 }            // System facts
});
```

---

### A Brief Synopsis: Summarizing Concepts

So, in summary, I added an event loop to be ready for anything later because when you meet the right people, you have to be ready for anything.

It’s only there for **Intentful State**, which you have to declare by wrapping your object with the `intent()` func (for rejecting ability). And then to reject, you have to keep it in mind that you have to go to the front of the line by **Capturing** and then stopping the intent for other people that are not you (even when you’re the owner). They need to know when you disapprove, though you can’t stop a man from wishing.

That does it.

- **State** is everything you’re used to. You can mediate and listen to it. No need for the event loop there (even if you can still capture or bubble, depends if you find a need to; otherwise, don’t bother with it).
- The rest are **Progressive Enhancements** for turning a state system into some kind of request manager—in other words, making a mirror where you can change the reflection to affect the state even when you know only the state.

If I succeed, I have successfully made you dumber, or at least just reduced the work you have to do. It all bears quite a level of complexity, but you decide for yourself whether your use case demands State or Intent.

- **Intent** should be used to switch states to avoid methods in the flow.
- If the state is a direct set on reality, you don’t need intent.

So:

- For a **Settings Object** (scroll speed, configurations): You need **State** since they update instantly but you should be semantic with naming meaning if your system will have an **Intent** counterpart and you have properties that are outside intents, you could keep them in **Settings**, **Status** or whatever.
- For **Video Play**: It’s **Intent** because you can’t just get it upon asking. It listens and declares when it’s ready, like a wish being granted. Intent for asynchronous and translating events architecture; State for immediate declarations and configurations.

Power is in your hands though, as mediation was not prevented. So if you could think up some other concept, fine. This is just what I have enforced for this architecture where event triggers, events, and state live in the same world as "intents and state", merging event flow and abstracting out the complexities of state transitions.

**For the Final Piece:**

- **Mediators:** For Data Integrity.
- **Intents:** For User Requests.
- **Rejection:** For Owner (of intent) Approval.

### A Friend's Comment: Transparency With No Locks

Lest I forget, there is a specific moment worth mentioning that led to the transparent nature of this architecture.

When you turn standard object actions like `set`, `get`, and `delete` into observable streams, it’s only right that the system is seen as entirely transparent. You can watch and listen to _anything_. The API doesn't cage you. It's like taking an open-book quiz where you literally own the textbook.

This wild concept became the primary goal for the core, all because a friend made a seemingly silly comment during the development of the theme feature on the second prototype.

He looked at it and went:

> _"When I change the player's colors to blue, it should change everywhere on the page."_

I was like, _that's impossible_... or it would have to be heavily hardcoded. Most developers would probably just resolve to doing exactly that and move on, but it was bugging me.

**The Problem with the Status Quo**:
According to pre-existing systems, the standard solution would have been to create a custom `color-change` event and allow outsiders to listen to it with the color as the payload.

But imagine scaling that. What if there were 60 different color subsets like `brand`, `theme`, `accent`, `complement`, and `supplement`? The custom events wouldn't stop. You'd be building an endless wall of hardcoded dispatchers no one might even use.

**The S.I.A. Solution**
It is quite satisfying that with the new core, all of those pathways are left completely open. **The properties of the object itself are the events.** This means no matter how large the state tree gets, it remains 100% transparent. You don't need a middleman. You just listen to the exact property and go about your business:

```javascript
this.config.on("css.brandColor", () => {
  // Update the UI
});
```

The friends you keep really matter. He was just being silly, and he knew that wasn't an easy thing to build, but that one comment was the exact catalyst that forced this architecture to operate with zero boundaries instead of me just adding a temporary patch.

Thanks, I guess :)

### After the Thought Process: Development and Testing

This part of this document is me logging various gathered information over time about high level ways to use the low level core.

**The Triad of Getters: Surgical Precision**
I’ve cracked the code on getter mediators. In this surgical world, we have three types: Virtual, Factual, and Mixed.

- **Virtual:** Pulls from an external source (like the DOM). During initialization, it’s a liar, it reports default values that will overwrite your config if you listen too soon. You must defer these (`lazy: true`) until setup is done and you can trust reality.
- **Factual:** Reads internal state (maybe processed). It always tells the truth and uses its own data. Never defer.
- **Mixed:** Reads external data like Virtual, but acts as the authority even during init. You don't defer it because sometimes checking reality is cheaper than blindly overwriting it (e.g., `video.src` vs `volume`). Blindly setting src causes expensive reloads; checking the "Mixed" truth first prevents that.

The Heuristics: Factual uses data and is true. Virtual ignores data and lies (defer it). Mixed ignores data but is true enough to prevent costly errors. Basically, any Virtual you find a reason not to defer; usually due to cost or complexity is Mixed. Be careful of Virtual though, they could lie to snapshots which could be good or bad for your state.

If initialization happens across multiple listeners, deferring the "liars" ensures no one reads garbage values before the state settles. That’s the logic for now.

I also exposed `tick()` for synchronous flushes with path based options when needed, incase you need a listener to operate immediately mutation happens maybe for dom construction or initialization.

Now, there's also watchers for listeners that need to state updates immediately so like the native `Object.set()`, doesn't use the granularity of the event wave but is for immediate synchronous update meaning the flow is Mediator -> Watchers -> Listeners.

#### The Final API Signature

```javascript
// 1. MEDIATORS (The Logic)
// "When someone tries to set volume, force it to be a number."
config.set("volume", (val) => Number(val));

// 2. WATCHERS (The Internals/Survival)
// "Immediately after volume changes, update the audio engine. Do not wait."
config.watch("volume", (val) => (audioNode.gain.value = val));

// 3. LISTENERS (The UI)
// "When you have a free moment, update the slider position."
config.on("volume", (e) => (slider.value = e.value));
```

NOTE: This signature can be skipped if you just used intents and put everybody in the sky, i'm only making this an options to cover any usecase considering I tested the reactor first on my pre-existing codebase that hasn't adopted SIA. If everyones living in the sky with just `.set()` and `.on()`, no one needs to touch the ground with `.watch()` and everything will be as fast as an airplane without the "jet lag" (UI Stutter). Sky here means outside the synchronous code thread that blocks the UI when layout thrashes. You should really only watch when you need precision and the value is not UI intensive for for forwarding changes so you're not later than a tick.

**The "Layman's" Pitch:**

> "Most video players try to paint the UI every time a variable changes. That’s like landing the plane to adjust the volume. TMG keeps the plane flying (logic) and only updates the cabin (UI) when the air is clear (Next Frame). That is why it feels as smooth as native."

_"I don't care if the volume changes 0.001ms later, as long as the slider animation doesn't thrash."_

### The Distilled Rules of Notifications 📜

#### Rule 1: The Rule of Survival (Sync) - `Reactor.watch()`

> **"If the next line of code will crash without this value, Watch it or stall if it's just UI."**
>
> - _Examples:_ `src`, `tracks`, `playlist`.
> - These are the **Engines**. They could stay on land.

#### Rule 2: The Rule of the Cloud (Async) - `Reactor.on()`

> **"If it is just for human eyes or ears, Batch it."**
>
> - _Examples:_ `volume`, `brightness`, `css`, `classes`.
> - These are the **Cabin Controls**. They live in the sky.

#### Rule 3: The Rule of Stall - `Reactor.stall()`

> **"If the UI needs to report a calculation from a scheduled listener maybe on the next line, wait for the dust to settle."**
>
> - _Example:_ Muting/Unmuting (calculating the restore volume).
> - Don't report the intermediate math. Stall until the final value is ready.

#### Worthy of Note: You can use `Reactor.tick()` to force updates to avoid stalling

### The Art of Resolution: The Power Line

I realized that a simple "Prevent Default" wasn't enough. It felt like silencing a subordinate rather than taking command. So, I introduced a political hierarchy to the architecture; a **Chain of Responsibility** that I call **The Power Line** for intents still btw.

In this system, we don't just stop things; we **Resolve** them. And unlike the chaos of the browser, rank is determined simply by **who got there first**.

#### The Hierarchy: Registration is Rank

Everything crucial happens in the **Capture Phase**. This is the active phase where the "Power Line" decisions are made.

1. **The Higher Power (Registered First):**
   If a Plugin wants to be a "Leader" (e.g., Audio Context), it must register _before_ the Tech. By capturing first, it gets the first look at the King's wish. It can choose to `resolve` (handle it) or `reject` (fail).
2. **The Adviser (The Tech):**
   The Tech also listens on **Capture**. It stands in the line just like everyone else.

- **If it sees `e.resolved`:** It realizes a higher power has already handled the situation. It stands down.
- **If it sees `e.rejected`:** It sees the Leader failed. It can decide to be stubborn and say, _"I will save this situation,"_ ignoring the rejection and executing the native behavior anyway.
- 2 & 3 can loop if you deem it possible.

3. **The Observers (The UI):**
   The UI listens on **Bubble**. It doesn't get involved in the politics; it just watches the aftermath. Whether the Leader resolved it or the Adviser saved it, the UI just reflects the final outcome.

#### The Protocol

- **`resolve(message | signature)`**: "I Got This." (Stops lower ranks from acting).
- **`reject(reason)`**: "I Failed." (Warns lower ranks, but doesn't stop them if they are stubborn).

This architecture allows for **Stubborn Competence**. A Plugin (eg: Volume Audio Context) can try to be fancy at the front of the line only if it listens first. If it fails, the Tech (further down the capture line) picks up the pieces. If the Tech handles it, the UI (bubbling up) never even knows there was a struggle, because it just sees a working player.

That is the Art of Resolution.

There's `init: true` now as an option for all listeners so the same logic can be shared for initialization and subsequent state updates. You can also pass a signal so it's on par with modern JS event listener patterns and for more cleaner code, easier on the garbage collector too; avoiding churn.

### The Data-Centric View (Shared Identity)

**The Logic**: If user_A and user_B point to the same memory address, they are the same thing. If I change the name on one, the other has changed too.

**Should all listeners fire?** Yes. If you update the object via Path A, Path B is now out of sync if it doesn't notify its listeners.

The reactor now supports this treating data as a first class citizen and avoiding the noise of nested proxies or stale updates using referencial integrity and a tracing algorithm to locate an object in it's state tree like a GPS using a map of the `object` world quite literally.

> **Author's Note:** This chronicle has remained untouched since the construction of the original library. However, because the philosophical foundation and architectural thinking were cemented long before the first line of code was ever written, the principles laid out here remain absolute. The core was built to be timeless; meaning this document stands not just as a technical manual, but as the definitive, unyielding bible of the S.I.A. ecosystem.
